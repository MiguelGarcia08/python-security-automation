# Python Security Automation

This repository contains Python scripts and projects focused on
security automation, API integrations, and cloud security workflows.

## Goal
Build production-ready automation for vulnerability management
and security operations.

## Tech stack
- Python 3.11
- Git / GitHub

# Python Security Vulnerability Processor

This project demonstrates a Python-based security automation workflow
for processing vulnerability data.

## Features
- Risk-based vulnerability prioritization
- Robust error handling
- Structured logging
- Modular design
- PEP8-compliant code

## How it works
1. Load vulnerability data
2. Filter based on CVSS and exploitability
3. Log processing events
4. Generate a severity summary

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
